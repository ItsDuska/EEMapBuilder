# EEMapBuilder

EEMapBuilder (Elysian Enlave Map Builder) is a small tool program for building worlds in my Elysian Enclave game. The program allows for the creation of a 2D tile map that stores the game's interactive elements such as NPC characters and other objects. Additionally, the program should be able to create objects that allow for transitioning from one room to another. The program saves all this in 32x32 tile-sized chunks in the .chunk file format, which I poorly created myself. This program is not perfect and could be made 200 times better, but it should work for my own use, so I do not recommend using this code for anything.
